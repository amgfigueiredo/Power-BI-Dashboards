## Features

- Employee Demographics Analysis: Gender distribution, age groups, and department-wise breakdown.

- Attrition Analysis: Identify patterns and factors influencing employee attrition.

- Performance Metrics: Insights into employee performance and productivity.

- Salary Distribution: Visualizations of compensation trends across departments and roles.

- Interactive Filtering: Users can apply dynamic filters to customize the dashboard view.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** Data visualization and dashboard creation.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Custom calculations and measures.

- **Excel/CSV:** Data sources for employee records and HR metrics.

## Datasets Used

- **Employee Information Dataset**: Contains employee details such as name, department, gender, age, salary, and tenure.

- **Performance Ratings Dataset:** Data on employee performance scores and promotions.

## Key DAX Functions Used

`Total Emp = COUNTROWS('HR Analytics Data')`

`Male = CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Gender]="male")`

`Female = CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Gender]="female")`

`% male=DIVIDE([Male],[Total Emp],0)`

`% female = DIVIDE([Female],[Total Emp],0)`

`Due for promotion = if(ISBLANK(CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Promotion Status]="Due for promotion")),0,CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Promotion Status]="Due for promotion"))`

`Not due = CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Promotion Status]="Not due")`

`% not due = DIVIDE([Not due],[Total Emp],0)`

`% due promotion = DIVIDE([Due for promotion],[Total Emp],0)`

`On Service = if(ISBLANK(CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Retreanchment statuts]="on services")),0,CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Retrenchment statuts]="on services"))`

`% on service = DIVIDE([On Service],[Total Emp],0)`

`Will be retrenched = if(ISBLANK(CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Retrenchment statuts]="Will be retrenched")),0,CALCULATE([Total Emp],'HR Analytics Data'[Retrenchment statuts]="Will be retrenched"))`

`% on service = DIVIDE([On Service],[Total Emp],0)`
